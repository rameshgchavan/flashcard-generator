3) Problem statement: I faced more difficulties while imitating Navbar. I am just little close.
4) Approaches:  I learned how to copy text to clipboard and how to get current url using react-copy-to-clipboard package and window.location.href.
5) Conclusions: I was so nervous now I am confident that I can also design frontend UI. Tailwind CSS classes helped me more.
